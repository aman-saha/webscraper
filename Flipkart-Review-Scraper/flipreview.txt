Review Content :
First to Flipkart delivery service - Thanks a lot, I received it earlier than promised. I also received a chocolate from you guys, it felt really nice. Multiplied my joys of receiving my new phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now to the iPhone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Packaging - As always - neat &amp; superior!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phone - It feels great. I personally chose the iPhone 7 over 7+ because of the size. Moving from iPhone 5 to 7 was absolutely no downer in terms of size, the size suited me well. Specifications wise - still exploring. ;)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What's evidently different - the home button (the number 3 pressure press feels quite weird. Chose number 1 option) and yes of course the no-audio jack. So you do receive wired earphones better known as lightning compatible earphones. The end of your wired earphones connect to the slot of the lightning connector.

Buying the most awaited phone of the year and that too from flipkart was amazing.
  <br/>
  Really thankful to flipkart for understanding the customer's egarness.
  <br/>
  Flipkart Delivered the product on 7/10/16 at 7.10 pm when apple conducted all india launch.
  <br/>
  This kind of commitment from flipkart towards its customers is highly appreciable.
  <br/>
  Flipkart is another word for Geniune products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iphone 7 in first looks is a awesome phone with gr8 camera. Altogether a new home button which is more faster than previous phones.
  <br/>
  build quality is very premium with black colour adding further to it.
  <br/>
  sound quality is also very good. Battery backup is very satisfactory.
  <br/>
  Highly reccomended.
  <br/>
  KEEP IT UP FLIPKART.

Review Title : Makes a Compelling Upgrade from the iPhone 6

Writing the review upgrading from an iPhone 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increased speed and camera are great! 3D Touch feels a little incomplete but is convenient nonetheless. While the design is the same as the 6, the black really makes it stand out. Stunning finish on the matte black.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Will update the review upon further usage.

Review Title : This is 7. But doesn't live upto expectations.

Upvotes : 9

Downvotes : 5

Review Content :
iPhone 7 - 32GB Black
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros :
  <br/>
  - Superfast A10 Processor
  <br/>
  - Improved Home button (Haptic Feedback)
  <br/>
  - Excellent Low light camera with Image stabilisation
  <br/>
  - 32GB Storage from base models
  <br/>
  - Improved Stereo sound from speakers
  <br/>
  - Great battery life. Almost lasts for a day with a full charge. Significantly better than the predecessor.
  <br/>
  - Most importantly, this time it is waterproof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons :
  <br/>
  - I had the iPhone 6S (16GB), I haven't noticed much difference and the aesthetics of the phone just feels the same. Not worth upgrading from an iPhone 6 / 6S.
  <br/>
  - No headphone jack. Have to insert the adaptor in order to use any external headphones with 3.5mm jack.
  <br/>
  - Screen quality is the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verdict : I feel the phone was overhyped while the phone is a very good buy for new iPhone users or anyone upgrading from 5S and below.

Review Title : i (for ideal) phone

Upvotes : 86

Downvotes : 119

Review Content :
It would be presumptuous to not acknowledge that all those who pre-ordered this device, myself included, have done it simply for the allure of the latest iPhone. Even as I say this, I wasnt entirely convinced of the iPhone 7 when I watched the livestream of the Apple Keynote. However, a timely launch in India, less exorbitant pricing and a hefty cashback was what finally swung me in favour of it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Apple might have not made much headway in design for 3 generations now, I take some solace in the fact that I got the Black variant which sets it apart from the earlier generations. Having said that, the accumulation of the incremental updates is what makes this a significant step up from the 6s - IP67 protection, cleaning up of antenna lines, camera with better low light performance and OIS, stereo speakers, brighter screen with wider colour gamut, 40% faster quad core CPU, hexa core GPU and the bigger 1960 mAh battery. However, the focus will be more on what has been lost, namely, the headphone jack and the physical Home button. Coming from Android phones with capacitive only buttons, the latter doesn't matter at all, especially since it is now a multi-function button that does a lot more than the physical one. However, I must admit that pressing it felt odd initially and I mistook the vibration as flexing of the case in which my phone was encased. The loss of the former however will not be an easy one. It may have been a courageous move but also a bit impractical. I use a Sony SBH54 Bluetooth headset and the audio quality is still some way off to justify using it all the time. It is even more antagonizing when you have invested a significant amount in purchasing high-end 3.5mm jack headphones. At least, there is the headphone adapter which comes only in white and goes very well (not!) with the Black variant. I guess that is a compromise I have to live with and really hope that Apple has made the Lightning port a lot sturdier. I can somehow accept this decision if indeed, as Apple has stated, it was a price to pay for a larger battery, water resistance and stereo speakers without ruining the dimensions, even though I can accept an additional 2mm of thickness any day. Apart from the device itself, you buy yourself in to a large repertoire of accessories that simply dont exist for other devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As far as iOS is concerned, Apple has been more forthright about picking up whats good in others (as has Android) which means a more accelerated rate of iOS progression compared to an approach of deterrence through suing. Also, Apples walled garden now has a pet door with overtures to developers to utilize aspects of iOS that were previously, preciously locked away. iOS also continues to be the platform of choice for innovative app developers who are not simply targeting income through baited ad clicks. Even Google and Microsoft continue to offer an incredible experience on iOS which is inexplicably better than what they offer on their own platform. It is perhaps not contestable that iOS offers the best security, privacy, optimization and consistency of any phone, even though most of it comes from Apples control of every aspect of the device. Also, the exclusivity of the OS has some appeal to it at a time when Android can be experienced on any PC. To sum it up, you cannot go wrong with buying the iPhone, unless you had to take out a mortgage to finance one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  P.S. I received my iPhone at around 8 p.m., about an hour after the launch and really loved the custom packaging. Enjoyed purchasing something from Flipkart after a long time.

Review Title : Received defective item , seller not helping

Upvotes : 48

Review Content :
Hi I've just got my iPhone 7 32 gb black , and one of the bottom speakers are not working . I called up the guys at service centre and this woman Shruti , who's a senior attended me and said that they can't help me anyhow , I'll have to visit the service centre . What kind of stupidity is this ? I spend more than 40,000 on a mobile phone thinking that it's flip kart and seller seems to be good and this is the type of stabbing they do to you. Now I'll have to run to the service centre for their bastardness , the retailer has mentioned 10 day replacement guarantee . I received my item 10 hours ago and this is how they work . The apple logo glass is tiny bit missing , this can never happen if u buy it from the store and this ensures the defective or factory item which they've sent me
  <br/>
  Don't ever but from this supercomputer net seller and never ever everrrrr trust people at flip kart . I'm really regretting as to what I've done . Would definitely never ever recommend or myself buy from flipkart. And if I get charged for this stupidity I will sue you sir / madam from supercomputer net . Mark my words , I will .
  <br/>
  And if you're even reading this try helping me out for the sake of ur customer loyalty , I've been ordering from u since years and even you flipkart ! Highly Disappointed and ensure coming back !
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Update 19/05/17 - received my replacement today. The product seems to be okay , but the box was duaty from inside and plastic wrap on phone had bubbles . Can't say what is happening to flipkart and to us . Even this seller , shreyansh pvt. Is a fraud i feel . Idk from where he's getti g such used products , replacing my item was a gamble , im not gonna try it again . There are slight scuffs on the phone . Idk what. Really giving up and never ever everrrr comimg back to shop from Supercom.net or flipkart , you gys suck !

Firstly flipkart did a fair job on delivering the phone despite the huge number of orders.
  <br/>
  Overall iPhone 7 is a nice upgrade from iPhone 6 as I got 3D touch, Live photos, better camera, Better processor, Stereo speakers and it's water proof.
  <br/>
  But I don't think it has much to offer if you are already using iPhone 6S.

Review Title : Amazing is the one word for Apple.

Review Content :
So I got my first Apple I Phone 7 , thanks to Flipkart for amazing low price of 38499/- on there big billion day, package arrived before time.
  <br/>
  Here was my New I phone 7, mesmerizing look, feature touch , crisp and clear display, sound at its best, even the ear-pods are too classy and give a good sound.  When I started using Apple I phone then i realized why they cost more than any other smartphone. They have terrific after sale support. My phone was heating a bit for Initial 2 days, then i contacted apple customer service through chat and phone support and they solved my queries .Apple has unique feature of adapting when we first start to use the phone and that's why  in initial days it will heat a bit to get with the envrm and it was true.  Now I don't feel like using other phone's ,I phone are light weight and this u can feel once u start using this gem device. Camera is above par no other phones comes close to pic quality than I phone 7 .Finally I must say if you have not used I phone , Use it for once you will surely not regret. Thanks.!!

Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery. No need to explain the product, iphone is just self explaintory.
  <br/>
  And for those having issues or claiming the product to be defected, first of all go for fassured seller only and watch out some unboxing videos beforehand so as to get an idea of sealed box and when ever unboxing new iphone just look out for sealing i.e. Original seal is not hampered and match that IMEI no of phone and bill with that of box, you will be good to go

At first I was very sceptical about the seller and genuineness of the product since I bought this product at extremely cheap rate during sale. However after one month of using it, the product has shown absolutely no glitches that makes me doubt that the product is counterfeit or something. Hence I would recommend others to go for this one.

Happy with the performance since I just switched from Oneplus 3T . But only issue is the battery backup after upgrading to ios 11. My advise to the newcomers, do not upgrade from ios 10 before the fix is being released by Apple !! Cheers !!

Review Title : iPhone 7.. premium phone

Upvotes : 4

Review Content :
Pros:
  <br/>
  Sleek and handy, no more chunks of heavy metal
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premium and stylish, Matt black looks royal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera is stunning, you can't believe, it nurtured a hidden photographer in me to such an extent that I bought a dslr now, most of my pics are clicked on it. Camera is comparable to point and shoot standalones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery life is more than sufficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  iOS is more secure and reliable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sound is louder and crisper then 6 th generation
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aluminium 7000 series is more sturdy
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No 3.5 mm, but there is an adapter to bridge that
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I my personal opinion screen should be 5 inch, reducing bezels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Price.. but I got it in deal, cheapest ever, thanks to flipkart
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enjoying my iPhone . Go for it else for i8 if budget doesn't matter for u ;)

  A better touch and response time then previous versions of iPhone. Black color is super cool, though not much change in looks. Camera upgrade is good, with a brighter display.
  <br/>
  Stereo sound is good, new home button is quite sensitive, overall a good buy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Delivery and packaging:
  <br/>
  Timely delivery and in a uber cool box, kudos to Flipkart for that

Review Title : iPhone 7 great value for money

Review Content :
Excellent and great value for money. It's been a great experience after moving from iPhone 4s for 4 years to iPhone 7. Everything seems to be new, fast touch response and finger print sensor is great. Best and fast processor in the current smartphones. Camera is outstanding, I always had better camera experience in iPhone 4s and now iPhone 7 with 12mp &amp; 7mp is really great, especially low light shots are great. Although missing 3.5mm jack but lightning cable for headphone and charger is also way too good. Overall it been a great buying experience with Flipkart with great discounts and exchange offer. Thumps up :-)

Review Title : Gorgeous black

Review Content :
iPhone 7 was launched at 7 PM IST on October 7 in India. I received an SMS at 7 PM that the delivery boy is out and I will be getting the product. I received my product at 8 PM, within one hour of the launch. With great excitement I open the packing that said priority. Upon opening I found a flipkart exclusive black box designed for iPhone 7. This packing is elegant and a surprise. Kudos to flipkart for the packing and delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coming to the phone:
  <br/>
  1) The colour is elegant. Even though the design is nearly the same except for the 3.5mm earphones jack, the colour is something which makes it different and gorgeous. The touch is awesome and the phone setup is easy.
  <br/>
  2) The speakers are louder than the previous versions of the phone. But I am not sure if it is 2 times the sound of previous phones.
  <br/>
  3) 4G reception is good. I tried Airtel 4G and Reliance Jio.
  <br/>
  4) The camera is good.
  <br/>
  5) I absolutely love the customisable home button which gives me feeling that I am pressing a button which is against the feeling of using most android phones.
  <br/>
  6) More storage is a delight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  1) The battery backup is not great. It is draining quite fast even at minimal YouTube and internet usage with no new apps installed and running in the background.
  <br/>
  2) The display satisfies my eyes but it could have been better when it comes to resolution. But I love what I am seeing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phone is gorgeously simple. Thanks to flipkart and Apple.

Review Content :
I have serched over all enternet for buying an iphone 7 i cheked many shopping sites reviews and all customers feedbacks and after talking with many friends finally i get that many friends buyed mobile from flipkart and they got authentic mobiles so i finally decided to buy from flipkart and at same time i listened about big 10 sale and i ordered at exect time for cod and i got it only for 39,999rs. Then i waited for 4 days and i got that product i have doubt in mind that i have buyed it online and also at time of sale, it will be authentic\real,then after payment i directly went with that box to inspire and unboxed their by recording full video by my mobile and then i have got a first look of mobile which is fresh look and looking perfectly new mobile my first doubt was cleared that it is not an empty box and not a box with a stone. Then they started mobile and checked all accessories and then said it is 100% real and then he activated my mobile and now I am enjoying it without any problem if any problem occurred in feature then their is warranty I can contact inspire(apple store) easily as it has all rights that any iPhone has. Thank you flip kart. Really 100% authentic. You can also search me on instagram I am student and really I got iPhone 7 at lowest price and as much as authentic as any other real iPhone in world.

I have ordered an I phone 7 and I got it on 25th of september. It works for 3 days and now it stop working unexpectedley. Its not even turning on now. Apple support is asking me to return it but there is no return option available on site. I want to replace it or want my refund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple is asking for refund from Flipkart and Flipkart is not giving any return option (Not even a single day replacement)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Will never buy anything from Flipkart and suggest you guys the same.
