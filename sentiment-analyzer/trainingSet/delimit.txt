I bought 2 iPhones with this seller, both have problems and I can't return them.
I don't know what they called certified refurbished, but all i received was a severly dented and scratched phone with a new screen. Also, it won't even turn on! DON'T BUY AND WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS.
The phone was in okay shape. Some dings around the camera area but it was marked STOLEN when we tried to activate it. Haven't been able to activate it yet but we will keep you posted.
I ordered the iPhone 6 64 gigabyte and looking through the package, the iPhone is freaking bent. Wasted my time and money. AVOID LIKE HERPES
box came empty
Phone constantly crashes. Battery is junk. Sold me a piece of junk and I want my money back. Don't buy. Spend the extra cash and go through a decent company
Dont waste your time! They sent me a locked phone that I can't even use!!! It literally says unlocked in the description but my phone is VERY LOCKED. I can't get it turned on..
I received the package but when I opened the box I did not have the cell phone, I need the cell phone or to get the money back
